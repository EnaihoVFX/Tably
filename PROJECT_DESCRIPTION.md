# Smart Tab Organizer - Project Description

## Problem Being Solved

Modern web browsing often results in tab clutter and disorganization. Users frequently have dozens of open tabs across different projects, making it difficult to:
- Find relevant content quickly
- Maintain focus on specific tasks
- Preserve important browsing sessions
- Switch efficiently between different contexts

This leads to decreased productivity, increased cognitive load, and frustration with browser management.

## Solution

Smart Tab Organizer is a Chrome extension that uses AI to automatically organize tabs, save browsing sessions, and provide intelligent assistance for daily browsing workflows. The extension leverages Chrome's built-in AI models (Gemini Nano) to understand content context and provide smart organization.

## APIs Used

This extension integrates with Chrome's built-in AI APIs:

1. **Prompt API for Web** - Used for intelligent tab categorization and content analysis. The API analyzes tab titles, URLs, and content to determine logical groupings.

2. **Summarizer API** - Generates concise descriptions for tab groups and saved sessions. Helps users quickly understand what each group contains.

3. **Writer API** - Creates smart, descriptive names for tab groups based on content analysis. Generates contextual descriptions for saved sessions.

4. **Rewriter API** - Optimizes tab titles and descriptions for better readability and organization. Improves the clarity of generated content.

5. **Translator API** - Handles multilingual content and international websites. Ensures proper categorization regardless of language.

6. **Proofreader API** - Ensures accuracy and quality of AI-generated content. Validates group names, descriptions, and summaries.

## Key Features
