# Workspace Tab Syncing Debugging Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ Workspace document exists in Firebase
- ✅ Workspace state document exists with windowId
- ✅ windowId matches current window (1470685416)
- ❌ Workspace not detected in popup
- ❌ Tabs not syncing

## Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Reload the Extension
1. Open Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Click the reload button on "Smart Tab Organizer"
3. This loads the latest code with detailed logging

### Step 2: Open Popup in Workspace Window
1. Make sure you're in the workspace window (should be window 1470685416)
2. Click the extension icon in the toolbar
3. Open Developer Console (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
4. Look for console logs

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
Look for these specific logs in order:

#### Expected Logs:
```
🔍 Checking workspace status for window 1470685416...
🔄 Trying Firebase fallback for workspace detection...
🔍 Looking for workspaces with windowId matching: 1470685416
📋 Checking X rooms in Firebase...
📋 Found X rooms to check
🔍 Checking room: [room name]
📋 Room data: {...}
📋 Room [name] workspace state: {windowId: 1470685416, tabs: [...], ...}
📋 Room [name]: windowId=1470685416 (1470685416), current=1470685416 (1470685416), match=true
✅ Found workspace via Firebase: [room name] for window 1470685416
✅ Window 1470685416 is part of workspace: [room name]
```

#### If You See Errors:
- "Firebase not ready yet" → Firebase initialization issue
- "No workspaces found" → Collection is empty
- "windowId mismatch" → Wrong window
- "Workspace check timeout" → Query taking too long

### Step 4: Create a Tab to Test Sync
1. In the workspace window, create a new tab (Ctrl+T or Cmd+T)
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Check console for tab sync logs:

#### Expected Tab Sync Logs:
```
📝 Tab created: [tab title], window: 1470685416, target window: 1470685416
🔄 Syncing tab created in workspace window 1470685416
🔄 Syncing tab created for room [room name]: [tab title]
📋 Current tabs in workspace: 1
✅ Added new tab to workspace: [tab title]
✅ Synced tab created to Firebase for room [room name] (1 total tabs)
```

#### If No Tab Sync Logs:
- Tab not in workspace window
- Background script not registered
- Listener not started

### Step 5: Check Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to: syncRooms → [workspace_name] → workspace → state
3. Check if:
   - windowId is correct
   - tabs array is being updated
   - lastUpdate timestamp changes

### Step 6: Verify Background Script
1. Open Chrome Extensions page
2. Click "service worker" or "background page" link under extension
3. Check console for background script logs

#### Expected Background Logs:
```
✅ Registered workspace window 1470685416 for room [room_name]
🔄 Started tab sync for workspace window 1470685416
🔄 Starting tab sync for room [room_name] in window 1470685416
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Workspace check timeout"
- **Cause**: Firebase query taking too long
- **Solution**: Check Firebase rules, increase timeout

### Issue 2: "No workspaces found"
- **Cause**: Collection empty or query failing
- **Solution**: Check Firebase Console, verify collection exists

### Issue 3: "windowId mismatch"
- **Cause**: Popup in wrong window
- **Solution**: Open popup from workspace window

### Issue 4: "Tabs not syncing"
- **Cause**: Background script not listening
- **Solution**: Check background script logs, reload extension

### Issue 5: "Firebase not initialized"
- **Cause**: Firebase connection failed
- **Solution**: Check Firebase config, network connection

## Debug Checklist
- [ ] Extension reloaded
- [ ] Popup opened in correct window
- [ ] Developer console open
- [ ] Console logs visible
- [ ] Workspace detection logs visible
- [ ] Tab created in workspace window
- [ ] Tab sync logs visible
- [ ] Firebase tabs array updated

## Next Steps After Debugging
If workspace detection works but tabs still don't sync:
1. Check background script service worker is running
2. Verify `startWindowTabSync` is being called
3. Check for errors in background console
4. Verify Firebase rules allow writes
