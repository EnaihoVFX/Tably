# Smart Tab Organizer - Complete Project Summary

## Project Overview

**Smart Tab Organizer** is a Chrome extension that uses Chrome's built-in AI models (Gemini Nano) to automatically organize tabs, save browsing sessions, and provide intelligent assistance for daily browsing workflows.

## Problem Being Solved

Modern web browsing often results in:
- **Tab Clutter**: Users have dozens of open tabs across different projects
- **Context Switching**: Difficulty maintaining focus when switching between tasks
- **Session Loss**: Important browsing sessions are lost when closing the browser
- **Inefficient Organization**: Manual tab organization is time-consuming and often forgotten

## Solution

The extension leverages Chrome's built-in AI APIs to provide:
- Automatic tab categorization based on content analysis
- Intelligent group naming and descriptions
- Session saving and restoration
- Context-aware organization
- Privacy-focused local AI processing

## APIs Used

This extension integrates with Chrome's built-in AI APIs:

1. **Prompt API for Web** - Intelligent tab categorization and content analysis
2. **Summarizer API** - Creating concise group descriptions and session summaries
3. **Writer API** - Generating smart group names and contextual descriptions
4. **Rewriter API** - Optimizing tab titles and improving readability
5. **Translator API** - Handling multilingual content and international websites
6. **Proofreader API** - Ensuring accuracy in AI-generated content

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Organization
- Automatic tab categorization based on content analysis
- Smart group naming using AI
- Color coding based on content type
- Context-aware organization

### Session Management
- Save complete browsing sessions
- Load saved sessions with one click
- Auto-save functionality
- Session organization and tagging

### Privacy & Performance
- Local AI processing (no external data transmission)
- Efficient tab analysis
- Minimal browser impact
- Secure local storage

### Core Components

1. **AI API Manager** (`ai-apis.js`)
   - Abstracts Chrome's AI APIs
   - Provides fallback handling
   - Manages API calls and responses

2. **Background Service Worker** (`background.js`)
   - Handles tab management
   - Integrates with AI APIs
   - Manages session storage
   - Provides message handling

3. **Popup Interface** (`popup.html` + `popup.js`)
   - User interface for extension controls
   - Session management
   - Status display
   - Settings configuration

4. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Analyzes page content
   - Provides visual feedback
   - Extracts metadata for AI analysis

## Installation & Usage

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. The extension will be installed and ready to use

### Usage
1. **Automatic Organization**: Extension automatically organizes tabs as you browse
2. **Manual Organization**: Click extension icon and use "Organize Tabs with AI"
3. **Save Sessions**: Enter session name and description, then click "Save Current Session"
4. **Load Sessions**: Click on any saved session to restore it
5. **Settings**: Configure auto-save and auto-organize preferences

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Tab Organization**: Test with 10-15 tabs across different categories
2. **Session Saving**: Save sessions with different names and descriptions
3. **Session Loading**: Load saved sessions and verify restoration
4. **AI API Integration**: Test with different content types and languages
5. **Performance Testing**: Test with 50+ tabs and verify performance

### Expected Results
- Tabs organize automatically and logically
- AI-generated names are relevant and descriptive
- Sessions save and load correctly
- Performance is smooth with many tabs
- Extension works reliably across different websites
